                    <p>This was an attempt of making a Star Wars blog reading list as part of my Full-Stack Developer course at 4 Geeks Academy Spain.</p>
                    <p>During this process, I faced a lot of questions and doubts, experienced some inconvenients and even some unexpected issues turned up. All this together made this project definitely more and more challenging over time.</p>
                    <p>However, I was able to overcome all adversities, exceeded my expectations...and literally copied and pasted this beautiful look-a-like "Star Wars" intro from somewhere in the Internet.</p>
